# Transformer Models Comparison for IoT Time Series Forecasting

This notebook compares the performance of three Transformer-based models (`Informer`, `Autoformer`, and `PatchTST`) on IoT time series forecasting.

## Steps in the Notebook

### 1. Import Required Libraries
- Import libraries for data processing, model evaluation, and visualization.
- Import custom modules for the dataset class and model definitions.

### 2. Set Device
- Set the computation device to GPU if available, otherwise CPU.

### 3. Load Pretrained Models
- Load the pretrained `Informer`, `Autoformer`, and `PatchTST` models from checkpoint files.
- Set the models to evaluation mode.

### 4. Load Preprocessed Dataset
- Load the preprocessed dataset from `etth1_processed.csv`.
- Extract the target variable (`OT`) for evaluation.

### 5. Create DataLoader
- Use a sliding window approach to prepare the data for evaluation.
- Initialize a PyTorch `DataLoader` with a batch size of 32.

### 6. Define Evaluation Metrics
- Define metrics for model evaluation:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE)

### 7. Evaluate Models
- Evaluate the pretrained models on the test data.
- Use separate functions for `Informer`/`Autoformer` and `PatchTST` due to differences in input format.

### 8. Compare Results
- Store the evaluation results in a DataFrame.
- Display the results as a table.

### 9. Plot Metrics
- Create bar plots for each metric (`MSE`, `MAE`, `SMAPE`) to compare model performance.
- Save the plots as a PNG file.

### 10. Save Results
- Save the evaluation results as a CSV file.
- Clear GPU memory after evaluation.
