# Informer Transformer Model for IoT Time Series Forecasting

This notebook implements an Informer Transformer model for forecasting IoT time series data. Below is a step-by-step explanation of the code.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

### Step 1: Import Libraries
- **Purpose**: Import necessary libraries for data processing, model building, and evaluation.
- **Details**:
  - Libraries like `torch`, `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib` are imported.
  - Custom modules for the Informer model (`ProbSparseSelfAttention`, `InformerBlock`, `InformerForecast`) and dataset class (`TimeSeriesDataset`) are imported.
  - The device is set to GPU if available, otherwise CPU.

### Step 2: Load Preprocessed Data
- **Purpose**: Load the preprocessed dataset for training and evaluation.
- **Details**:
  - The dataset is read from the `../data/processed/etth1_processed.csv` file.
  - The `OT` column is selected as the target variable.

### Step 3: Create DataLoader
- **Purpose**: Prepare the data for training using a sliding window approach.
- **Details**:
  - A `TimeSeriesDataset` object is created with a window size of 96.
  - A PyTorch `DataLoader` is initialized with a batch size of 32 and shuffling enabled.

### Step 4: Train the Informer Model
- **Purpose**: Train the Informer Transformer model on the training data.
- **Details**:
  - The `InformerForecast` model is instantiated and moved to the GPU (if available).
  - The model is trained for 10 epochs using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function and the Adam optimizer.
  - The training loss is printed for each epoch.
  - The trained model is saved to `../models/checkpoints/informer_transformer_model.pth`.

### Step 5: Evaluate the Model
- **Purpose**: Evaluate the model's performance on the test data.
- **Details**:
  - The model is set to evaluation mode, and predictions are generated for the test data.
  - The predictions and true values are inverse-transformed to their original scale using the `MinMaxScaler`.

### Step 6: Calculate Metrics
- **Purpose**: Calculate evaluation metrics for the model.
- **Details**:
  - The Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) are calculated between the true values and predictions.
  - The metrics are printed to the console.

### Step 7: Plot Predictions vs True Values
- **Purpose**: Visualize the model's predictions against the true values.
- **Details**:
  - A line plot is created to compare the true values and predictions.
  - The plot is saved as a PNG file in the `../../outputs/metrics/informer/` directory.

### Step 8: Save Results
- **Purpose**: Save the evaluation results for further analysis.
- **Details**:
  - The true values and predictions are saved as a CSV file in the `../../outputs/metrics/informer/` directory.
